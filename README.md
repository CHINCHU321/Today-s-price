Before we create a function to scrap details from the page let us visit a Flipkart product page like this one (https://www.flipkart.com/apple-2020-macbook-air-m1-8-gb-256-gb-ssd-mac-os-big-sur-mgn63hn-a/p/itmde54f026889ce) and find the elements that have the name and the price of the product. We will need the elementâ€™s class name to be able to find the elements when we extract the data.
