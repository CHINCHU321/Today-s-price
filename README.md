3: basic information

Before we create a function to scrap details from the page let us visit a Flipkart product page like this one (https://www.flipkart.com/milton-executive-lunch-3-containers-box/p/itmf3whyhbgey4uw ) and find the elements that have the name and the price of the product. We will need the elementâ€™s class name to be able to find the elements when we extract the data.
